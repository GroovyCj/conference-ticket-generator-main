## Overview
This is my first front end project.  It is a form, with validation, that generates a ticket when the user submits the form.  I added a little extra info to allow the user to back out and change things as they please.  I should also note, this was built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn that Front-end development is a touchy project that has some quirky interactions when building a cohesive layout.  I spent a lot of time looking at the screen yelling with a contorted look wondering why my layout looks wonky.  However, I was able to get it to work in the end, with the help of some good ole coffee. HTML, CSS and Javascript are married together unlike other languages, (converting a Java Class to a Python Class).  

### Continued development

I want to add React components to this project once I finish learning it for the first time.
